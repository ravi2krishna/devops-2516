    -> DevOps 

        -> What Is DevOps ?

            -> DevOps is a set of "Practices" & "Tools"

                -> To implement DevOps Practices we need Tools  

        -> Why DevOps ?

            -> DevOps unites "Software Development" & "IT Operations" teams 
                to "Deliver Softwares Faster" & "More Reliable".

        -> Any Application You want to build 

            -> Development Team [ Application is still on Laptop Of Developers, dev, qa servers ]

                -> To Build Applications 

                    -> Softwares Architects 
                    -> Senior Developer 
                    -> Junior Developer 
                    -> Software Testers 
                    -> etc 

            -> Operations Team

                -> To Deliver/Deploy Applications [ Application is running on Production servers i.e end users ]

                    -> System Admin 
                    -> Network Admin
                    -> Cloud Admin 
                    -> Security Admin 
                    -> etc 
            
            -> Development == Cooking Food 

            -> Operations  == Serving Food 

            -> Cook Food ===> Server Food [ Develop ===> Deploy ]

            -> Before DevOps these teams were working in isolation and if something
                goes wrong in Delivery / Deployment "BLAME GAME STARTS" 

            -> Eventually Organization is losing 

    -> Who will Implement DevOps ?

        -> DevOps Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" Using "Tools"

        -> Skill Set Based On Job Role 

            -> Developer: Programming Languages 

            -> System Admin: Server Management(linux admin)

            -> DevOps Engineer: DevOps Practices Using "Tools"

    -> DevOps Engineer

        -> Develop Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" Using "Tools"
        so that Organizations can "BUILD" & "DEPLOY" Softwares "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"


    -> "DevOps Practices"           ======>         "Tools"              ======>    Use

    -> Version Control System &     ======>         "Git" & "GitHub"     ======>    CODE TRACKING 
        Source Code Management 

    -> Continuous Integration &     ======>         "Jenkins"            ======>    AUTOMATION
       Continuous Deployment  

    -> Containerization             ======>         "Docker"             ======>    FASTER 

    -> Orchestration                ======>         "Kubernetes"         ======>    RELIABILITY 


    -> DevOps Has Prerequisites 

        -> Server (*) (AWS - AZURE)

        -> Linux (*) (Command Line Interface - CLI)

        -> Software Development Life Cycle (*) (SDLC - Application)

    -> DevOps Practices & Tools

=============

    -> Servers 

        -> A Server is a "computer system" that provides data or services 
            to others computers, known as "clients" over a network.

        -> Laptop can be used by one person at a time 
        
        -> Server can be used by multiple persons(clients) at a time 

    -> Physical Server 

        -> Physical Server Consists Of "Hardware" + "Operating System" (Linux OS - Ubuntu)

        -> CPU(Processor) + RAM + HDD + N/W Card
    
    -> Server Softwares 

        -> Web Server : Hosts and Serves Web Pages / Web Applications Over Internet 

            -> Examples : Apache Web Server, Nginx Web Server, IIS Server etc 

        -> Database Server : Hosts Application Data & Transactions

            -> Examples : MySQL Server, Postgres Server, MS SQL Server etc 

        -> Email Server : Software that sends, receives, and stores emails.

            -> Examples : Postfix Server, SendMail, Send grid etc 


    -> DevOps Context 

        -> DevOps Engineers will deploy and configure Web Servers, Email Server, 
            Automation Servers etc to ensure High Availability, Performance, Security etc 
        

    -> Where To get servers from ?

        -> Purchase Server 

            -> Purchasing Servers is QUITE COSTLY and from learning perspective we cannot
                afford a server 

            -> Rather than Purchasing Server, we want to "RENT SERVERS" 

        -> As per example discussed 

            -> Buying Server == Buying Bike 

            -> Renting Server == Renting Bike 

            -> Renting Bike : Pay for how many kilometers you traveled 

            -> Renting Server : Pay for how much you use i.e "PAY AS YOU GO" price model

                -> 1 Server for 1 hour 
                -> 1 Server for 5 hour 
                -> 1 Server for 5 days 

            -> Where can i rent bike ?

                -> Ola, Uber, Rapido etc 

            -> Where can i rent server ?

                -> AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI etc

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> Cloud computing is the "on-demand" delivery of "IT resources" 
            like servers, storage, and software over the "internet" 
            on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.

    -> In our course will implement servers on both "AWS" & "AZURE"

        -> Login To AWS 

            -> https://aws.amazon.com/console/ 

    
    -> Firewall 
    
        -> A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls 
            incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules (protocols) 

        -> SSH Protocol (Secure Shell)

            -> Is a network protocol used for secure remote access to 
                computers over an unsecured network.

            -> SSH allows users to log in, run commands and transfer files securely.

            -> SSH typically runs on TCP port 22

    -> How To Connect With Server ?

        -> SSH Client Softwares 

            -> A software program which uses SSH to connect with remote linux server 

        -> Windows Laptop 

            -> GitBash (recommended) it provides ssh & also git 
            -> Terminal 
            -> Putty 
            -> etc 
        
        -> SSH Command 

            -> ssh -i identity_file username@public-ip-address 

            -> ssh -i 2516.pem ubuntu@13.56.155.130 
        
        -> MAC Laptop 

            -> Terminal (already installed)

        -> SSH Command 

            -> chmod 400 identity_file 

                -> NOTE: Above command will set file permission to READ ONLY 

            -> chmod 400 2516.pem 

            -> ssh -i 2516.pem ubuntu@13.56.155.130

=============

    -> AZURE Server Setup 

        -> Azure Virtual Machines (VM's) is a part of Azure's cloud-computing platform, 
        Microsoft, that "allows users to rent virtual computers(servers)" 
        on which to run their "own computer applications".

        -> Server                   ==> Azure Virtual Machine (VM)
        -> Server Name              ==> VM Name 
        -> Operating System         ==> Image ( Linux Ubuntu 22.04)
        -> CPU + RAM                ==> Sizes (b1s, b2s etc)           
        -> Login / Authentication   ==> Key Pairs (Public Key & Private Key)

        -> Storage (Hard Disk)      ==> Disk is 30 GB 

    -> NOTE : Using AWS or AZURE or any other cloud provider, it doesn't make any difference moving forward 

    -> Using gmail.com on Edge, Chrome, Firefox etc - outcome is same 

    -> We are using Linux Servers, which has only CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> CLI - Command Line Interface

        -> CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with servers 
            through "text based commands" 

        -> CLI is very helpful in Automating Repetitive Tasks 

    -> Requirement From Customer 

        -> Create 100 Text files 
        -> Assume you don't have any CLI knowledge 
        -> Then we are left with GUI - Graphical User Interface 
            -> 1 text file creation - 3 seconds 
            -> 100 text file creation - 300 seconds (5 mins)
            -> 100000 text file creation - 300000 seconds (5000 mins)   

    -> Resolving Requirement From Customer Using CLI 

        -> touch file-{1..100}.txt

    -> Hardware & System Software(OS) Commands 

        -> CPU / Processor Info 

            -> cat /proc/cpuinfo 
        
        -> RAM Info
