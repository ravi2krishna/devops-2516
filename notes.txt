    -> DevOps 

        -> What Is DevOps ?

            -> DevOps is a set of "Practices" & "Tools"

                -> To implement DevOps Practices we need Tools  

        -> Why DevOps ?

            -> DevOps unites "Software Development" & "IT Operations" teams 
                to "Deliver Softwares Faster" & "More Reliable".

        -> Any Application You want to build 

            -> Development Team [ Application is still on Laptop Of Developers, dev, qa servers ]

                -> To Build Applications 

                    -> Softwares Architects 
                    -> Senior Developer 
                    -> Junior Developer 
                    -> Software Testers 
                    -> etc 

            -> Operations Team

                -> To Deliver/Deploy Applications [ Application is running on Production servers i.e end users ]

                    -> System Admin 
                    -> Network Admin
                    -> Cloud Admin 
                    -> Security Admin 
                    -> etc 
            
            -> Development == Cooking Food 

            -> Operations  == Serving Food 

            -> Cook Food ===> Server Food [ Develop ===> Deploy ]

            -> Before DevOps these teams were working in isolation and if something
                goes wrong in Delivery / Deployment "BLAME GAME STARTS" 

            -> Eventually Organization is losing 

    -> Who will Implement DevOps ?

        -> DevOps Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" Using "Tools"

        -> Skill Set Based On Job Role 

            -> Developer: Programming Languages 

            -> System Admin: Server Management(linux admin)

            -> DevOps Engineer: DevOps Practices Using "Tools"

    -> DevOps Engineer

        -> Develop Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" Using "Tools"
        so that Organizations can "BUILD" & "DEPLOY" Softwares "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"


    -> "DevOps Practices"           ======>         "Tools"              ======>    Use

=============

    -> Servers 

        -> A Server is a "computer system" that provides data or services 
            to others computers, known as "clients" over a network.

        -> Laptop can be used by one person at a time 
        
        -> Server can be used by multiple persons(clients) at a time 

    -> Physical Server 

        -> Physical Server Consists Of "Hardware" + "Operating System" (Linux OS - Ubuntu)

        -> CPU(Processor) + RAM + HDD + N/W Card
    
    -> Server Softwares 

        -> Web Server : Hosts and Serves Web Pages / Web Applications Over Internet 

            -> Examples : Apache Web Server, Nginx Web Server, IIS Server etc 

        -> Database Server : Hosts Application Data & Transactions

            -> Examples : MySQL Server, Postgres Server, MS SQL Server etc 

        -> Email Server : Software that sends, receives, and stores emails.

            -> Examples : Postfix Server, SendMail, Send grid etc 


    -> DevOps Context 

        -> DevOps Engineers will deploy and configure Web Servers, Email Server, 
            Automation Servers etc to ensure High Availability, Performance, Security etc 
        

    -> Where To get servers from ?

        -> Purchase Server 

            -> Purchasing Servers is QUITE COSTLY and from learning perspective we cannot
                afford a server 

            -> Rather than Purchasing Server, we want to "RENT SERVERS" 

        -> As per example discussed 

            -> Buying Server == Buying Bike 

            -> Renting Server == Renting Bike 

            -> Renting Bike : Pay for how many kilometers you traveled 

            -> Renting Server : Pay for how much you use i.e "PAY AS YOU GO" price model

                -> 1 Server for 1 hour 
                -> 1 Server for 5 hour 
                -> 1 Server for 5 days 

            -> Where can i rent bike ?

                -> Ola, Uber, Rapido etc 

            -> Where can i rent server ?

                -> AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI etc

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> Cloud computing is the "on-demand" delivery of "IT resources" 
            like servers, storage, and software over the "internet" 
            on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.

    -> In our course will implement servers on both "AWS" & "AZURE"

        -> A Linux file system is a hierarchical, "tree-like" structure 
        that organizes data and manages how it is stored on storage devices. 
        It is unified into a "single" structure, starting from the 
        root directory (/), which is the top of the hierarchy. 

        -> Key directories include /bin (binaries), /etc (configuration files), 
        /home (user directories), and /var (variable data like logs).

        / (root): The top-level directory of the entire file system.
        /bin: Contains essential command-line binaries (programs).
        /boot: Contains files needed for the boot process, such as the kernel and bootloader.
        /dev: Contains device files that represent hardware devices.
        /etc: Contains system-wide configuration files.
        /home: Contains the home directories for regular users.
        /lib: Holds system libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin.
        /opt: For optional software packages.
        /tmp: Temporary files, which are often deleted upon reboot.
        /usr: Contains most user utilities and applications.
        /var: Variable data, such as logs and temporary files that are kept between reboots.

    -> Permissions 

        -> Permissions are grants that we apply to owners(users), groups and others.

        -> Working with permissions, helps you understand, why we are getting 
            permission denied error

            -> touch /opt/hey.txt

                -> touch: cannot touch '/opt/hey.txt': Permission denied

            -> touch ~/hey.txt 

                -> No permission issues, but why ?? 
            
        -> To understand permissions

            -> touch hello.txt 
            -> ls -l 

                -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 13 Nov 17 04:19 hello.txt

                rw- : user / owner 
                rw- : group 
                r-- : others 

                r : read ==> w : write ==> x : execute 

            -> rwx rwx rwx (permissions)

    -> Set file to read only permission 

        -> chmod command to set permissions

            -> chmod ug-w file_name (remove write permission for user & group)
            -> chmod ugo-wx file_name (remove write permission for user & group)

            -> chmod ugo-r file_name (no read permissions also)
            -> chmod ugo+r file_name (grant read permissions also)

        -> Absolute Mode 

            -> Use numbers for permissions 

            -> 4 - read
            -> 2 - write
            -> 1 - execute
            -> 0 - no permission 
            -> https://www.globo.tech/learning-center/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chmod-Notation-1.png
            
            -> rw- rw- r-- [ 664 ] 
                -> read & write for user & group
                -> read only for others

            -> Earlier we used chmod 400 key

                -> sudo chgrp developers /opt/db.properties

                -> sudo chmod 440 /opt/db.properties

                -> sudo grep developers /etc/group 

        -> Use case for execute permission

    -> Did we get some control on Linux Server using CLI ?

        -> In Win == We can Do in Linux (CLI)

    -> NOTE: All the activities we performed so far are related to "OPERATIONS" 

        -> As a DevOps Engineer, now you know about Operations     

    -> NOTE: In Parallel we have "DEVELOPMENT" team, who are "DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS" 

        -> By Next Week, As a DevOps Engineer, you will be knowing about Development 

2nd Dec 2025
=============

    -> "DEVELOPMENT" team

        -> DEVELOPMENT Team mainly builds Applications 

        -> DEVELOPMENT Means Coding 

    -> Version Control Systems (VCS)

        ->  Version control / Revision control / Source control
            is a process that helps to keep track of changes made to 
            files (computer programs, web site files, documents etc)

        -> https://www.sirhow.com/uploads/2023/07/check-gpay-transaction-history-step-4.jpg

        -> Advantage Of VCS is Revert Changes To Previous Working Versions, 
            if there are issues in new version

        -> Git - Client Side Software     - Developer 

            -> Git a tool to implement VCS 

            -> Git helps in tracking code / changes in your code 

            -> Git tracks code in your laptop 

        -> GitHub - Server Side Software  - Organizations

            -> GitHub provides a platform to store code 

            -> GitHub Stores All Versions Of Code in centralized location (github.com)

        -> Repository 

            -> A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. 
                Developers can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

        -> JIRA 

            -> Jira is a proprietary product developed by Atlassian that allows 
                bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management. 
        
        -> GitHub Projects & Issues (FREE)

            -> GitHub Projects are a feature within GitHub designed for planning and tracking work

            -> GitHub Issues is a built-in, lightweight issue-tracking system in every repository 
                used for planning, discussing, and tracking work like 
                bug reports, new features, and tasks.

            -> NOTE: Within Project we have Issues
